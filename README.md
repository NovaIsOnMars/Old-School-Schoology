# Old-School-Schoology
Bring back the good ol' days with throwback Schoology icons.

<h2>How to install:</h2>
(As of writing, I do not plan to upload this extension to the Chrome Web Store due to the fee)
- Download the source code.
- Open chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
- Toggle "Developer Mode" in the top right corner to on.
- Press "load unpacked".
- Select the root directory of the extension (extension must be unzipped).
- Make sure the extension is enabled

<h2>After installation, configuration of the extension is necessary.</h2>
- Click on the puzzle piece on the top bar, and then select the extension.
- You will see a popup window. In the input box, enter the URL to your Schoology site and press "Add" (as oftentimes, different schools have different URLs for it).
- Check the boxes for which changes you would like to enable. (All three is recommended).

<h2>FAQ:</h2> (not like I've gotten any questions anyways cuz no one even uses this)
- Q: Why does it say that it has access to all sites?
- A: This is because Schoology tends to have a different url for each school district it is used by. The extension accesses all pages, but only runs if it detects the current website as one from your list (created in the popup menu).
- Q: *Literally any glitch*
- A: THANKS FOR FINDING IT!!! Please report it to me via the issues tab on GitHub.

Thanks for reading this! Have a good day!
